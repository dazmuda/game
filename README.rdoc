== Welcome to Click Quest!

This is a Rails game I created during App Academy to solidify my understanding of the MVC framework. In the version I play, all the enemies are slimes (like from Dragon Quest) but you can make the enemies whatever you want!


== How to Play

1. Clone this project onto your computer.

2. In your terminal, change your directory to "game" and start the web server.
       <tt>cd desktop/superCoolStuff/game (or wherever you put it)
       rails server</tt>

3. Go to http://localhost:3000/players and click the button to create a new character.
I'm going to assume your playerID is 1 in the next few URLs.

4. Ask a friend to come over and create new enemies for you to fight by visiting http://localhost:3000/players/1/mobs/new 
You will be able to fight these enemies using other player IDs, too.

5. Now go back to http://localhost:3000/players and play the game as your character!


== Features to Add

* Images!
* Random mob generation
